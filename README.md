# Description:
While learning Android Studio and XML for this project and utilizing my skills in Java, I have created an app that provides a healthy outlet for people to journal their remarks from day-to-day life while keeping track of their overall mood. By providing personalized suggestions, users can receive practical recommendations for activities to do when they are feeling a particular mood, making the app an effective tool for emotional self-regulation and self-care. This allows the user to follow suggestions based on what they provided, as opposed to being recommended universal activities such as meditation or exercise. By developing Moodsy, I hope to inspire students and professionals alike to prioritize their mental health and well-being through efficient and accessible technology.
